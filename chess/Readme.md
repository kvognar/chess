## Chess

##### Partner for today: [Jeff Quizon](https://github.com/jjquizon)

This is a simple chess game built using the Tk GUI toolkit. Click a piece to select it; click a highlighted square to move there. Users can save and load games. Enjoy!

This game requires the tk gem, which doesn't play well with RVM.
